# Market Watch App - Level 4 Capstone Project

Market Monitoring App using the Alpha Vantage API.  This App will allow a user to perform several actions, including retrieving a detailed quote on an individual stock, creating a watch list, and displaying a list of the most traded stocks of the day.

## MVP

Using React Router, the app will have 3 views: 
1. Home 
    - Contains basic app info.  Also where a user can search an individual stock
2. Hot Stocks 
    - Most Actively Traded Stocks for that day
3. Watch List 
    - User will be able to build a list of stocks to watch.
    - Note: List will not be saved when the user ends the session
