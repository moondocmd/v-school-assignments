Born in Detroit during the 80's, I grew up in the early Internet days.  I've always been interested in technology, and started coding and building computers as a teenager.  

After High School I joined the Army and served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.  While in the Army I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, and followed up with a Master's a few years later.  My first job out of college was as a Software Engineer.  Coding in C#.  Not long after starting, I was offered a position in software sales, and have more or less been on the business side of software ever since.

When I'm not working, I love to travel.  I've been to four continents, and even spent two years living and working in Italy!

Currently, I work as a Software Solutions Expert at Cox Automotive.
